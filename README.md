Maintenance Request Form and Admin web page built in C#

Pretty simple website. Uses a web form to collect data from the user, converts that data into a readable and printable email, and adds the data to a database so it can be tracked and manipulated in a gridview. 

This was done really quickly so it is a bit sloppy. If you plan on using it make sure to change it to use XML for email addresses and other data. I am going to delete the email address we use, that I hardcoded in, so you will have to add your own.
